Sequential data (timeseries + text)
## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of transfer learning techniques using pre-trained models to solve tasks like image classification.

## Topics Covered
- Transfer learning with pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet).
- Fine-tuning pre-trained layers for domain-specific tasks.
- Model evaluation and hyperparameter optimization.

## Objectives
- Explore how pre-trained models can enhance task performance.
- Apply transfer learning to reduce training time and improve model accuracy.

## Datasets Used
- CIFAR-10: Image dataset for multi-class classification.

## Acknowledgments
